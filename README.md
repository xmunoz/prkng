# prkng
prkng is a Montreal-based startup that I recently interviewed with. They asked me to write this app as part of their interview process. The live demo can be found [here](http://www.xmunoz.com/prkng/trees). The data processing and reformatting script can be found in bin, and is done in Python. The rendering, filtering, and display is client-side javascript, relying heavily on [mapbox.js](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/api/v2.1.9/) and [turf.js](http://turfjs.org/).
